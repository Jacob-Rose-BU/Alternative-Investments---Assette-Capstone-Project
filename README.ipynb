        "\n",
        "This project was developed by a student-led team in Boston University’s MSBA Capstone Program in partnership with **Assette**, a leading client reporting platform for asset managers. Our team focused on the **Alternatives** vertical, designing a modular and scalable data pipeline that ingests real and synthetic financial data, processes it through a production-ready Python workflow, and populates a Snowflake database for downstream use in ESG-focused investment fact sheets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our solution enables Assette and other asset managers to automate the creation of data-rich fund reporting outputs—even when working with limited or unstructured ESG datasets.\n",
